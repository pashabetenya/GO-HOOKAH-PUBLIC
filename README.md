# application.

This app is commercial and will eventually appear on various platforms. The idea is to collect all interesting places in one place and get the necessary information.

All content in terms of writing any scripts for this application can not put up, forbidden by studio policy. Allowed only in the form of some kind of design to put up.


## description.

In time, the application will be written out completely, and transferred to a clean architecture. After this I will be able to write a detailed description.
